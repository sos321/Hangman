# Hangman

Simple yet fun game in which you try to guess a word in as little guesses as possible. If you take too many guesses you get hanged.

This is my very first own project design and programmed by myself.

## Technologies

-   HTML & CSS with Sass
-   JavaScript
-   Modules:
    -   Circle Type

## What I learned

Hangman took me about 3 days of hard work to complete and gave me a lot of new informations about web design:

-   How to use NPM and install dependencies
-   How to animate SVG graphics
-   Writing Sass
-   Project structure
-   Writing Markup files

## Biggest obstacle

The biggest obstacle was to resolve an issue with the installed dependency and to come up with a nice dunctional design.

## Possible extensions

-   [ ] Animating the hangman on restart
-   [ ] Animating the hangman on hover
-   [ ] Adding you lost / won text
